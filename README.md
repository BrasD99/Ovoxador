<p>
  Introducing a new system for training athletes. It processes video recordings of a team sport game from various cameras, combines data and presents them in virtual and augmented reality.
</p>

## Neural Network Models

The solution uses a variety of neural network models to solve the tasks:

- [**YOLOv8**](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) - detector for detecting people and sports equipment on video frames,
- [**DeepSort**](https://github.com/ZQPei/deep_sort_pytorch) - tracker for detecting players on video frames,
- [**TorchReId**](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid) - reidentification of players on various tracks,
- [**DensePose**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/projects/DensePose) - getting the texture of the player on the video frame,
- [**PARE**](https://github.com/mkocabas/PARE) - determine the pose of the player on the video frame,
- [**LaMa**](https://github.com/saic-mdal/lama) - image processing and field texture acquisition.

## To-Do List

- [x] Reidentification optimization (now we are using SQLite database to store features)
- [ ] Multithreading support to speed up the work of modules
- [ ] Calculation of performance metrics of athletes
- [ ] GUI refinement
- [ ] VR/AR solution using Unity (will be moved to another repository)
- [ ] Beautiful animated gif for README ;)
